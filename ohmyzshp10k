1. Install zsh in Ubuntu using an apt package manager
    sudo apt install zsh

2. The package manager will install the latest release of Zsh which is 5.8
    zsh --version
    zsh 5.8 (x86_64-ubuntu-linux-gnu)

3. We can also check with cat /etc/shells , to see if Zsh in available on the valid login shells. If Zsh has been setup, /usr/bin/zsh will exist in the list of valid login shells.

4. Set Zsh as default shell
    chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh

5. Log out and then login again to your terminal to use the new Zsh shell.
    echo $SHELL
    /usr/bin/zsh

6. Install oh my zsh using curl
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

7. Use agnoster zsh theme
    Edit the ~/.zshrc file, edit this following line
        ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
    Into
        ZSH_THEME="agnoster" # (this is one of the fancy ones)
        # see https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#agnoster
    The powerline may looks broken as the screenshoot above. But donâ€™t worry. What we need to do is install the powerline font. Run this command in the terminal :
        sudo apt-get install fonts-powerline
        Now open a new terminal

8. Install powerlevel10k for Oh my zsh

Run this following command :

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
Now, edit the ZSH_THEME in ~/.zshrc file into :

ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
Open a new terminal, and you should see the powerlevel10k theme has applied. If the p10k configuration wizard does not start automatically, you can run the configuration wizard the powerlevel10k theme with this command :

p10k configure
After you run the command above, p10k will prompt some questions, and you can choose the answer based on your personal preferences. Hereâ€™s the final look of my zsh :


9. Install Dracula theme for GNOME terminal

Install dconf-cli with following command :

sudo apt-get install dconf-cli
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/dracula/gnome-terminal

Now run the installation script :

./install.sh
Then follow the instructions, when the prompt ask you to choose a profile, choose the profile that we have been created before.

Now back to preferences setting, set dracula as default profile.


Now, start a new terminal session, and see the dracula theme has been applied in the GNOME terminal


Install plugins (zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlighting)
